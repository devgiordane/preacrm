# Prea CRM

Prea CRM is a rebellion against bloated software.

It is inspired by the Preá — a small Brazilian rodent that survives not by size, but by agility, awareness, and efficiency.

It carries nothing it does not need.

Neither do we.

## Why Prea Exists

CRMs became monsters.

Too many dashboards.
Too many pipelines.
Too many features no one asked for.
Too much noise.

Prea CRM does less.

On purpose.

It focuses on the essential unit of relationship:

Email.

Not deals.
Not funnels.
Not fake productivity theater.

Just contacts, messages, status, and tags.

Everything else is automation.

---

## What Prea Is

Prea CRM is:

* A clean email list
* Email status tracking
* A writing interface
* Tags for organization
* A robust, automation-first API

That’s all.

No bloat.
No enterprise theater.
No complexity for the sake of selling complexity.

If you need more, build around it.

Prea is infrastructure.

---

## Automation First

Prea is not meant to trap you inside a UI.

It is meant to connect.

Use it with:

* n8n
* Zapier
* Your own backend
* Internal workflow systems

The API is not an afterthought.
It is the core.

You automate.
Prea stores the signal.

## License — Freedom With Responsibility

Prea CRM is licensed under AGPL-3.0.

You are free to:

* Use it commercially
* Modify it
* Self-host it
* Offer it to clients
* Integrate it anywhere

If you deploy it publicly as a service, you must open the source code of the version you are running.

You cannot:

* Take the code, modify it, and sell it as a closed-source SaaS
* Lock it behind proprietary walls

If you build on Prea and put it on the internet, you share your changes.

Freedom goes both ways.

## For Agencies, Freelancers, and Operators

We encourage you to:

* Self-host Prea for your clients
* Customize it
* Automate it
* Charge for infrastructure
* Charge for hosting
* Charge for support
* Charge for integration
* Charge for reliability

Build services around it.

But do not pretend the CRM itself is proprietary.

Prea is open infrastructure.

Your value is your expertise — not artificial software scarcity.

## Contributing

Prea grows carefully.

We welcome:

* Pull requests
* Improvements
* Refactors
* Performance gains
* API enhancements
* Bug fixes

We reject:

* Feature bloat
* Complexity without necessity
* Enterprise gimmicks

Every line of code must justify its existence.

Minimalism is not aesthetic.

It is discipline.

---

## Principles

Small surface area.
Clear API.
Self-host friendly.
Automation-native.
No unnecessary abstraction.
No product theater.

If it doesn’t make Prea simpler or stronger, it doesn’t belong.

---

## Final Words

The Preá survives because it stays light.

Prea CRM survives the same way.

Build around it.
Automate it.
Host it.
Improve it.

But don’t bloat it.

Small is powerful.
